## 👋 Hi there, I'm Tikki

### 📗 About Me
Hello! My name is Timothy Cui, but I usually go by Tikki. I'm currently a
student at Virginia Tech who's majoring in Computer Science. I'm passionate
about all things computer science, but I'm particularly interested in AI/ML. I
specifically wish to dive into autonomy related to robotics and vehicles.

### 🎓 Education
I'm finishing up my Bachelor of Science at Virginia Tech. After (hopefully)
graduating this spring of 2024, I will continue my education at Virginia Tech
with a Master of Engineering in Computer Science. Throughout my Master's, I plan
to specialize in *Data Analytics & AI*.
