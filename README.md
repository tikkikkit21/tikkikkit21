## 👋 Hi there, I'm Tikki

### 📗 About Me

Hello! My name is Timothy Cui, though I usually go by Tikki. I'm passionate
about all things computer science and I aim to be a well-rounded programmer.
I've taken lots of electives and LinkedIn Learning courses to help broaden my
skillset. However, I'm mainly interested in AI/ML, particularly when it comes to
computer vision and vehicle/robotic autonomy.

### 🎓 Education

I graduated from Virginia Tech last spring with a Bachelor of Science in
Computer Science. I am continuing my education at Virginia Tech with a Master of
Engineering in Computer Science. During my Master's, I will be concentrating in
Data Analytics & AI.
